Market Basket Analysis (MBA), or Recommendation Engine, uncovers associations between products by looking for combinations of products that frequently co-occur in transactions.  Some ways that a retailer could use MBA insights:

1. Targeting marketing campaigns by sending out pormotional coupons to customers for products related to items they recently purchased.

2. Increasing cross selling opportunities by grouping products in the design of the store layout.  For example, if you find that people who buy movies also buy popcorn, you could display popcorn right beside a movie display.

3. Using online recommendation engines.  If you have ever shopped online, you probably have seen this already.  For example, Amazon shows "Customers who viewed this item also viewed" and "What other items do customer buy after viewing this item" sections when you click on a product on their website.  

4. Segment customers based on buying patterns.  An interesting example is [Target identifying a teen was pregnant](http://techland.time.com/2012/02/17/how-target-knew-a-high-school-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-parents/) and targeting her with specific ads.
